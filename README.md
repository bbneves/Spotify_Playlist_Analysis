## Selected Topic 
For this project, our team decided to perform analysis on the audio features of songs from some of the most popular Spotify playlists. We used Spotify's API to retrieve data up to 100 songs per playlist selected, and then used a supervised learning model to predict the popularity score of a song given certain its audio features.

## Topic Selection Process
Our team members, **Bruno Blaszcyzk Nieves**, **Frank Bucalo**, **Hunter Gierhart**, and **Tyler Comerford,** have a shared interest in music, with Hunter working at a record label. The rise in popularity of streaming services as a means to consume music has provided a plethora of new, valuable metrics to analyze, for companies, artists, and enthusiasts like us. Analysis on this data can be used as a tool to target audiences, improve reach, and uncover trends on a mass scale.

Our project centers around DSP playlisting: record labels and artists have a vested interest in obtaining favorable playlisting from Spotify curators - a task that is easier said than done. By analyzing audio features for songs by playlist, our group hopes to uncover useful trends for content creators and owners to utilize when pitching their music for editorial placement. As the largest DSP, Spotify is the most important player in recorded music today. Their API makes more data available to the public than ever before, and is the perfect tool for music related data analysis.

## Description of source of data 
We scraped together the database that we used for this project ourselves using Spotify's API. Our finalized dataset is in the form of a csv file that contains several key metrics for each song. Metrics in our dataframe included 'danceability', 'energy', 'key', 'loudness', and 'popularity', among others. These metrics are assigned to each song by Spotify using algorithms that they've developed. While this data itself is public, details on the algorithm and the processes of generating these scores are not.

### Playlist Selection Criteria

We chose 100 editorial Spotify playlists of the most popular musical genres based on the following criteria:

* 100,000+ follower playlists only
* No regional playlists (“Hot Hits Brazil,” “New Music Friday Germany," etc)
* Playlists for frontline releases only (no, catalog releases, i.e., “80s classic hits” or “Best of The 90s”)
* No artist-specific playlists (ex. "This Is Katy Perry")
* Ideally genre playlists (Ex. “Indie Pop,” “Sludge Rock” etc)
* No “New Music Friday” type playlists that are different every week (every playlist should have generally consistent audio features from week to week)
* No chart playlists (ex. “Top Songs Global,” “Viral Hits”)
* Editorial Playlists only (Official Spotify playlists only)

## Questions to answer with the data 
Our target variable in our machine learning model is 'popularity.' Theoretically, we want an artist to be able to predict the popularity of a song from their catalog based off of the audio features generated by Spotify. Ideally, an artist could plug the metrics of their song into our model and would in return receive a predicted popularity score that would tell them how likely it is that their song would become popular on Spotify.

## Communication protocols
Our team communicated mainly via Slack and twice a week via Zoom meetings.
